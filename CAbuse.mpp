//LABEL(CAbuse, EN) Implementation of Child Abuse

/* NOTE(CAbuse, EN)
	Sets a child's abuse status.

	- Data Requirements

	The annual probabilities of becoming abused is given by the AbuseRates 
	parameter. A child's probability of becoming abused is affected by:
	- Gender
	- Socio_economic_state
	- The child's mother's disease state
	- Age

	A child can only become abused from the day the child turns 12 until the day
	before the child turns 19.

	- Implementation Details

	This event is first scheduled the moment when the child becomes 12. The event is
	then rescheduled whenever one of the indices of the abuse rates table changes. The
	child's gender and socioeconomic status cannot change in this model. The event is thus rescheduled 
	every year when the child ages and everytime the mother's disease state changes.

	The event is simply scheduled by drawing a random number from a uniform distribution
	and dividing it by the abuse probability of the child.

	In the case where the mother's disease progresses, the child's age will not be an integer.
	This special case is handled by scheduling the child's abuse event using the child's age
	rounded down to the nearest integer to lookup the child's abuse probability. 
	The event is then scheduled as previously.
